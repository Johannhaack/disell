Welcome to disell
==================

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Currently supported only on **Linux**.

--------------------------------

**Disell** is a high-performance segmentation framework for Dark Field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM).  
It leverages parallel CPU processing to efficiently segment dislocation cells, even when boundaries are weak or noisy.

--------------------------------
üîç Key Features

- Probabilistic segmentation: compute likelihood of modeled cells
- Optimized for large-scale 2D and 3D data
- Roadmap: 4D support in development
- Includes low-level and high-level API

--------------------------------
üöÄ How to Use

Use the `SegmentationDataset` class for a structured workflow.  
For custom pipelines, call the low-level segmentation and registration functions directly.
